		<p>Dear Git, <br> What is it that you want from our relationship? I hardly understand what it is that you do.</p>
		<p>Thanks for being speedy! (FYI: Sometimes people need to learn to take their time learning!)</p>
		<p>I have to admit I do admire your integrity. But how well can you really keep me safe? With the cloud revealing all my weaknesses, TSA constantly stalking me, and Edward Snowden seeking Asylum in Russia I don't know who is left to defend our integrity. I hope you're on our side.</p>
		<p>Although if I were to choose your single best quality, I'd say it's your unwavering support in all aspects of my sights. Not only do you follow me wherever I go, but you actually understand who I am. When it comes to romance, spontaneity can by key as long as the other follows. Babe, you got that down pact!</p>
		<p>We're never breaking up! I may never look back, so thanks for always being there for me <i>Git &lt;3 </i> </p>
