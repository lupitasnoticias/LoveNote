		<p>Baby, Github, You're my Number 1.</p>
		<p>You always keep it 100, exactly the way I need you to.</p>
		<p>I told Git earlier that I'd never leave him, but Github I can't deny that I love you so much more.</p>
		<p>Knowing that you host Git, I'm sure he'll understand. </p>
		<p>You allow me to easily <i>see</i> what you're keeping track.</p>
		<p>Because of you I can easily work with other people on group projects and <i>know</i> that everyone must be held accountable.</p>
		<p>Nowadays everyone wants something to make himself faster, stronger, happier. You provide that like no other!</p>
		<p>You're almost perfect, Honey. But I hate that I have to spend my own hard-earned money just to get some one-on-one time with you. I mean c'mon! </p>
		<p>Sorry if that seemed heartless. Your capabilites to track all of my firends' works is so great that I really shouldn't complain.</p>
		<p>You help me so much. I can never look back.</p>
		<p>Honey, I'll never leave you. you're my #1 forever! And I mean it this time. (Please don't tell Git! I can't bear to break his heart.</p>
